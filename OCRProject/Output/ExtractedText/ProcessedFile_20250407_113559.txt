The pipeline should be something like below diagram. Grey slots are placeholders for changeable light blue modules.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of
sitting by her sister in the café, and of having
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it
had no pictures or conversations in it, “and
what is the use of a book,” thought Alice,
“without pictures or conversations?”

So she was considering in her own mind, (as
well as she could, for the hot day made her
feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
worth the trouble of getting up and picking
the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that;
nor did Alice think it so very much out of the
way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she
thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her
that she ought to have wondered at this, but
at the time it all seemed quite natural;) but
when the Rabbit actually zook a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then
hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it,
and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it,
never once considering how in the world she
was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped

suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had
not a moment to think about stopping herself
before she found herself falling down what
seemed to be a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went
down to look about her, and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to
look down and make out what she was
coming to, but it was too dark to see
anything: then she looked at the sides of the
well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves: here and there
she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
She took down a jar from one of the shelves
as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE
MARMALADE,” but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like
to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
underneath, so managed to put it into one of
the cupboards as she fell past it.

Al.ice was beginning to get very tired of’
sitting by her sister in the café, and of having
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it
had no pictures or conversations in it, “and
what is the use of a book,” thought Alice,
“without pictures or conversations?”

So she was considering in her own mind, (as
well as she could, for the hot day made her
feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
worth the trouble of getting up and picking
the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that;
nor did Alice think it so very much out of the
way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she
thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her
that she ought to have wondered at this, but
at the time it all seemed quite natural;) but
when the Rabbit actually zook a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then
hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it,
and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it,
never once considering how in the world she
was to get out again.

‘The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped

suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had
not a moment to think about stopping herself
before she found herself falling down what
seemed to be a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went
down to look about her, and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to
look down and make out what she was
coming to, but it was too dark to see
anything: then she looked at the sides of the
well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves: here and there
she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
She took down a jar from one of the shelves
as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE
MARMALADE,” but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like
to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
underneath, so managed to put it into one of
the cupboards as she fell past it.

VYAl dlC L e e l e SRR LR R AR TN () (SRS Concert about? HOW
about creation, exploring a visceral and shared collective memory we've heep
prainwashed into believing never existed?

Conspiracy theory, my ass. Schools and teachers, the motor vehicle bureau,
the IRS, the military, the line at the bank, the television set, the newspapers at
the checkout stand, the news on your radio, the billboards along the highway,
and now a hundred thousand cold-comfort Web sites. All are tuned to your
brain at the deepest level and you have lined up for the coolest, latest-model
implant. The carrier wave has been tuned at huge cost to deliver a single mes-
sage: you are not free, you desire nothing but the products we produce, you
have no world but the world we give you.

  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
   

If you're OK with this, then eat it up. There’s a bulimic’s dream-feast of
killer kontent on the way. But if it already makes you want to puke, get angry.
Write it, code it, paint it, play it—rattle the cage however you can. Stay hungry.
Stay free. And believe it: win, lose, or draw, we're here to stay. Armed only
With imagination, we’re gonna rip the fucking lid off.

Tha r market.
