about creation, exploring a visceral and shared collective memory we've heep
prainwashed into believing never existed?

Conspiracy theory, my ass. Schools and teachers, the motor vehicle bureauy,
the IRS, the military, the line at the bank, the television set, the newspapers at
the checkout stand, the news on your radio, the billboards along the highway,
and now a hundred thousand cold-comfort Web sites. All are tuned to your
brain at the deepest level and you have lined up for the coolest, latest-model
implant. The carrier wave has been tuned at huge cost to deliver a single mes-
sage: you are not free, you desire nothing but the products we produce, you
have no world but the world we give you.

If you’re OK with this, then eat it up. There’s a bulimic’s dream-feast of
killer kontent on the way. But if it already makes you want to puke, get angry.
Write it, code it, paint it, play it—rattle the cage however you can. Stay hungry.
Stay free. And believe it: win, lose, or draw, we're here to stay. Armed only
With imagination, we're gonna rip the fucking lid off.
